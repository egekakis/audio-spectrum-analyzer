Audio Spectrum Analyzer Problem Decomposition
---------------------------------------------
1) Write script to isolate audio frequencies from a signal (FFT time domain...
signal, split about frequency characteristics, define criteria for dB levels...
in given frequency range)
2) Draft ATMega328P(or other MCU) circuit schematic, interface MCU with VCC,...
PC interface, and spectrum output display interface
3) Trace schematic onto PCB, figure out wiring from surface mounted PCB...
components to signal display
4) Draft mount/chassis schematic in CAD
5) 3D print mount/chassis, mount PCB, display, and audio interface
---------------------------------------------
Raspberry Pi vs Arduino MCU? Does it matter if I want audio streaming on...
local device to FFT or do I just need to take an analog signal from an...
aux input to analyze?

First design python GUI for digital signal FFT display, might be easiest to...
transfer from code to analog signal processor

Would prefer ability to detect music stream locally, then display...
corresponding audio spectrum, this would allow for any device on ...
the local network to have their audio analyzed

Could pull from Spotify API, or somehow take any audio streaming on...
the local network and analyze

Might be worth customizing a PCB with Raspberry Pi MCU (maybe STM32F405RG)

Goal: Pull any Spotify streaming data from the local network and perform...
FFT locally, split frequencies about a display and characterize dB...
intensity, all on an external, custom PCB and custom display mount
